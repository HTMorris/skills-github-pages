# INTRODUCTION

As population continued to age and decline in some countries, the issue of productivity has began to come increasing important in policy circles.

## Objectives
The Objective of this blog is to organise and share my thoughts on different issues impacting productivity.

## Working definition and Beneficiaries
Productivity is defined as output per unit of inputs. It is viewed as a win-win scenario, as increased productivity, that is lower cost per unit of output, may lead to:
- Higher Profits for Firms 
- Higher Wages for workers
- Lower prices for consumers

These benefit of higher productivity will also translate in higher revenue for government from a larger tax base (i.e. higher profits and wages), lower poverty from higher wages and lower prices.

# Methodology

The question then becomes why are some countries, industries, firms or persons more productivity than others? What can relatively low productivity institutions learn from high productivity insitutions. 

The following papers will be used to gain knowledge on productivity
